## Finding Jobs

### Basic Search

Click **Search** to see results. Each job card shows the title, company, location, salary, and when it was posted.

### AI Deep Match

Our AI can find jobs that match your resume even better:

1. Make sure you've uploaded a resume and set it as **Primary**.
2. Click **AI Deep Match** instead of regular Search.
3. Our AI analyzes your background and finds jobs where you're a strong fit.
4. You'll see a **Match %** score on each job card — higher means a better fit.

**Tip**: Use Deep Match when you want high-quality leads. Use regular search to discover more opportunities.

### Stats & Insights

At the top of the tracker, you'll see:

- Total saved jobs.
- Count in each stage.
- Your estimated response rate (interviews + offers ÷ total applications).

### Career Development Tab

Track your long-term goals:

- Roles you want to grow into.
- Certifications you're working on.
- Learning resources and courses.

These often come from suggestions in your AI-generated documents.

## AI Document Generator

This is where JobHunter really shines — creating job-specific applications in minutes.

### What You Need First

- A **primary resume** uploaded in Resume Manager.
- A **saved job** from Job Search (or you can paste a job description manually).

### Creating a Document

2. **Select Job**: Pick from your saved jobs or paste a job description.
3. **Generate**: Our AI creates a tailored document optimized for that role.
4. **Review**: Check the ATS score, see which keywords matched, and read the improvement suggestions.
5. **Export**: Copy to clipboard, download as text, or save it directly to that job.

### ATS Score

ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores tell you how well your document will pass through employer software:

- **70%+**: Good — likely to pass through.
- **80%+**: Great — strong chance of being seen.
- **90%+**: Excellent — highly optimized.

### Improvement Suggestions

If your score could be higher, we'll tell you:

- Keywords missing from your application.
- Certifications to consider.
- Experience gaps to address.

Use these suggestions to improve over time.

**Tip**: Always review and lightly edit AI-generated documents before submitting. They should sound like you.
