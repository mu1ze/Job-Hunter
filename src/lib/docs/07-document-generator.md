## ATS Score

ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores tell you how well your document will pass through employer software:

- **70%+**: Good — likely to pass through.
- **80%+**: Great — strong chance of being seen.
- **90%+**: Excellent — highly optimized.

## Improvement Suggestions

If your score could be higher, we'll tell you:

- Keywords missing from your application.

- Experience gaps to address.

Use these suggestions to improve over time.

**Tip**: Always review and lightly edit AI-generated documents before submitting. They should sound like you.
