## Application Tracker

Think of the tracker as your job search command center — like a Kanban board for your job hunt.

---

## Pipeline Stages

- **Saved**: Jobs you found interesting but haven't applied to yet.
- **Applied**: Jobs where you've submitted an application.
- **Interviewing**: Jobs where you've scheduled or completed interviews.
- **Offer**: Jobs where you received an offer.
- **Rejected**: Jobs that didn't work out.

---

## Moving Jobs Along

- **Drag and drop** a job card from one column to another to update its status.
- When you move a job to "Applied," "Interviewing," or "Offer," we automatically track the date.
- This helps you see how your search is progressing over time.

## Stats & Insights

At the top of the tracker, you'll see:

- Total saved jobs.

Track your long-term goals:

- Roles you want to grow into.
- Certifications you're working on.

These often come from suggestions in your AI-generated documents.
