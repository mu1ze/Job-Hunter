## Your Dashboard

Your dashboard is your home base. Here's what you'll see:

- **Quick Stats**: How many jobs you've saved, applied to, and interviews scheduled.
- **Recent Activity**: New alerts, recent documents, and updates.
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons to jump into job search, resume manager, or document generator.

**When to visit**: Start here at the beginning of each session to decide what to work on next.
