# AI Deep Match: How It Works

AI Deep Match is a sophisticated search and ranking system designed to pair you with the roles where you have the highest probability of success. It leverages your uploaded resume to perform a multi-layered analysis beyond simple keyword matching.

## The Process

### 1. Profile Extraction
Whenever you click the **AI Deep Match** button, the system analyzes your **Primary Resume** in real-time to extract:
- **Core Skillset**: The top 3-5 technical and soft skills identified by the AI.
- **Career Trajectory**: Your most recent job title and level of seniority.
- **Professional Context**: Key industry terminology from your professional summary.

### 2. Targeted Deep Search
Instead of a broad search, the system constructs a complex search query combining your most recent role with your strongest skills. This ensures the initial pool of jobs is already highly relevant to your specific background.

### 3. Compatibility Evaluation
Every job result is passed through a scoring algorithm that evaluates three primary vectors:

| Vector | Weight | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skill Alignment** | **50%** | Measures the direct overlap between your extracted skills and the job's requirements. |
| **Experience Relevance** | **30%** | Compares the job title against your work history to ensure career progression or lateral fit. |
| **Industry Context** | **20%** | Analyzes sub-keywords in your summary to detect niche industry matches. |

### 4. Smart Ranking & UI
Results are automatically sorted by their **Compatibility Score**. 
- **85% - 100% (High Match)**: Highlighted with a 🏆 Trophy and Green badge. Indicates an exceptional fit.
- **60% - 84% (Good Match)**: Shown with a Blue badge. Indicates a strong role where you meet most requirements.
- **Under 60%**: Shown with a subtle Gray badge. These roles may require a bit more effort to bridge the skill gap.

## Benefits
- **Reduce Application Fatigue**: Focus your energy on the top 10% of jobs where you actually fit.
- **Data-Driven Confidence**: Know *why* a job is a good match before you even click apply.
- **Optimized for Canada**: All searches are automatically restricted to the Canadian market to ensure local relevance.
